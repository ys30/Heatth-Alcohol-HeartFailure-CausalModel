Data were drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–March 2020 (cycle P_), a complex, multistage probability sample of the non-institutionalized U.S. population. Multiple NHANES modules were merged using the unique respondent identifier (SEQN), including demographics, alcohol use, medical conditions, anthropometrics, smoking, physical activity, diet, and comorbidity questionnaires.
